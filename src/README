My application has two components: an AlbumList and a FilteredList. 
I create a list of albums in App.js and then pass in that list as a prop to the FilteredList component that is returned in App.js.
    
FilteredList.jsx: this component is responsible for all of the filtering, sorting, adding and removing functionality of my application.
This component includes the following functions, which are explained in the inline comments in FilteredList.jsx
    - onSelectFilterGenre(event)
    - matchesFilterGenre(item)
    - onSelectFilterMood(event)
    - matchesFilterMood(item)
    - filterList(list)
    - onSelectSortLikes(event)
    - sortList(list)
    - addToPlaylist(item)
    - removeFromPlaylist(item)

In FilteredList's render function, I start by creating three navbars, one for filtering by genre, one for filtering by mood, and one for sorting by number of likes. 
I then create an AlbumList component, which takes in the album list from FilteredList's props and maps each album to a Card component from material-ui. In order to 
ensure that the albums are displayed according to the filters chosen by the user, I use state. The state of genre and mood are initialized to "All" so that at first, 
all of the albums are rendered. Then, if a user clicks on a specific filter or sorting property, it changes the state so that only the albums that match that filter/sorting 
property are rendered. AlbumList is also responsible for the styling of each album. Each album also has an "Add to playlist" button which, when clicked, calls FilteredList's 
addToPlaylist() function. Therefore, I also render a "Playlist" div which displays all of the albums that a user adds to their playlist. This is done by creating an empty 
array in FilteredList's state and then every time addToPlaylist() is called, the added album is added to the playlist state array. Once again, I map every album in the 
playlist array to a Card component from material-ui. Then, each album in the playlist has a "Remove from playlist" button which calls removeFromPlaylist() when clicked on, 
which removes the album from the playlist state array. In FilteredList, I also have a "Total songs" aggregator which keeps track of how many songs a user has in their playlist. 
I accomplish this by having an aggregator state, which is initialized to zero. Every time a user clicks "Add to playlist", the addToPlaylist() function increments the aggregator 
state by the number of songs in that album. Every time a user clicks "Remove from playlist", the removeFromPlaylist() function decrements the aggregator state by the number of 
songs in that album.
